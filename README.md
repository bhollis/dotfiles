# Ben's Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository. It configures:

* ZSH, with a nice clean minimal prompt that still gets across info about your Git status. The prompt omits information that isn't special, such as your username (when you're you) and your hostname (when you're on the same host).
* Emacs, with a lot of customizations to try and make it more powerful.

Don't try to use this directly - instead, browse through it and see if there's anything you'd like for your own dotfiles. I've tried to comment everything nicely.
